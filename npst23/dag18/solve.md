Perseus and Xerxes are people related to ancient times, same time as the spartains 
and stuff. The number 300 and the title is also a clue that this is the time 
period of interest. Some research gives that the Scytale cipher was in use in
that time period. An online Scytale solver (https://www.dcode.fr/scytale-cipher)
brute-force solved it by pasting the the message and reviewing the output.

The relevant configuration is the 33x128 (turns x letters per turn) and the flag
is `pst{var_julenissen_kong_leonidas}`.
